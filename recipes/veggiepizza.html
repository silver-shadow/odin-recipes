        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Press crescent roll dough into the prepared jelly roll pan to form a crust. Let stand 5 minutes. Pierce with
                 a fork.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is fully cooked and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool 
                completely.</li>
            <li>Combine sour cream, cream cheese, ranch seasoning mix, dill, and garlic salt in a medium mixing bowl. 
                Spread the cream cheese mixture on top of cooled crust. Arrange broccoli, radish, onion, bell pepper, 
                carrot, and celery on top of the cream cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Cover and let chill, 1 to 2 hours. Cut chilled pizza into 16 squares to serve.</li>
