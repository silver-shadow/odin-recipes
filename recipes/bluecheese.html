        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Blue cheese (or bleu cheese) is semi-soft cheese with a sharp, salty flavor. It is made with cultures of 
            the edible mold Penicillium, giving it spots or veins throughout the cheese in shades of blue or green. 
            It carries a distinct smell, either from the mold or from various specially cultivated bacteria such as 
            Brevibacterium linens, which also causes foot odor and other human body odors.</p>
        <p>Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, and others have spores mixed in with the 
            curds after they form. Blue cheeses are typically aged in temperature-controlled environments such as caves. 
            It can be eaten by itself or can be spread, crumbled or melted into or over many other foods.</p>
